title: "About Me"
---
Welcome to my web page! I'm currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics. I earned my Ph.D. at the <a href="https://physics.northwestern.edu/">Department of Physics and Astronomy</a> and <a href="https://ciera.northwestern.edu/">CIERA</a> at Northwestern University. I simulate globular clusters using the <a href="https://clustermontecarlo.github.io/CMC-COSMIC/">Cluster Monte Carlo code</a> powered by supercomputers at Northwestern. My research focuses on the dynamical evolution of compact objects in globular clusters, especially the interactions between neutron stars and black holes, the birth and life of millisecond pulsars and the formation of gravitational wave sources. I'm originally from Southern China and got my Bachelor’s degree in Physics at Zhejiang University in the beautiful city of Hangzhou. Outside of research, I enjoy playing tennis, video games, hiking, camping and downhill skiing.

I am a Ph.D. candidate at CIERA/Northwestern University. I use supercomputers to model globular clusters, and study the dynamical evolution of compact objects within. Specifically, I simulate the formation and evolution of neutron stars and pulsars in globular clusters. I first came to Northwestern for a Master’s degree and was working on developing next-generation telescopes. I later find my true passion in modeling and predicting the fundamental mechanisms that shape the universe.

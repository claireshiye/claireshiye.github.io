I am originally from Southern China and earned my Bachelor’s degree in Physics at Zhejiang University at the beautiful city of Hangzhou. I first came to Northwestern for a Master’s degree and was working on developing next-generation telescopes. I later find my true passion in modeling and predicting the fundamental mechanisms that shape the universe. I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Physics and Astronomy and CIERA at Northwestern University. I simulate globular clusters using the Cluster Monte Carlo code powered by supercomputers at Northwestern. My research focuses on the dynamical evolution of compact objects in globular clusters, especially the interactions between neutron stars and black holes, the birth and life of millisecond pulsars and the formation of gravitational wave sources. Outside of research, I enjoy playing tennis, video games, hiking and camping.

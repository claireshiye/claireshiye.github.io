Globular clusters are one of the densest and most dynamically active stellar systems in the Universe. They are groups of ~ 1 million stars bound together by gravity, constituting spherical systems a hundred thousand times more dense than a typical galaxy. Thanks to this dense environment which leads to frequent gravitational encounters between stars, globular clusters are very efficient in producing exotic objects such as millisecond pulsars, low-mass X-ray binaries and binary black hole mergers.

## Neutron Stars and Black Hole Dynamics

The compact objects (black holes, neutron stars and white dwarfs) in globular clusters are dynamically coupled. Due to mass segregation, black holes dominate the core of many globular clusters. Gravitational encounters within black holes and between black holes and other stars have significant effects on the evolution of other compact objects and their host clusters. In the figure below I show 2-dimentional projections of two typical globular clusters from simulations. The one on the left contains more than 100 black holes, and the one on the right has only one black hole. We can see that the positions of the neutron stars related to the center of their host clusters depend on the number/mass of black holes in the clusters. This coupling leads to many interesting results such as the anti-correlation between the numbers of millisecond pulsars and black holes in globular clusters <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...877..122Y/abstract">(Ye+2019)</a>, and the low merger rate of double neutron star and neutron star-black hole binaries from globular clusters <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...888L..10Y/abstract">(Ye+2020)</a>.

## Neutron Star Binary Mergers
Although globular clusters can produce many exotic objects, the neutron star binary merger rates from globular cluster are very low.
